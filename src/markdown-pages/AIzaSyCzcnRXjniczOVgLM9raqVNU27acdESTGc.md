hello everyone and welcome to
the new podcast i'm toby duckman and i'm
jt
and together we're here with the doctor
academy of dreams [ __ ]
hey everyone welcome to rules as written
the new podcast from two handsome devils
i'm toby
i'm the handsome devil hey
[Music]
and we are gonna be looking in this
podcast
and the rules of d and how you can apply
them and also the kind of social aspect
so
jt what do you like about d d
all right it's all right i guess
so this this first episode we're going
to try and do a kind of
introduction to d the whole the whole
shebang if you've only got 15 minutes to
tell someone what d d is how to play it
send them this this episode and
hopefully we'll do a good job so the
first thing we should go over is the
basics
i think dice is a good place to start
what do you think
sure yeah i mean every every game's got
some physical thing that's the
so yeah d uses seven dice
that are in a wonderful myriad of shapes
and sizes
yeah especially the one that you lost
so dice um is the basis of any dnd game
really
you have your seven dice and each of
them are denoted
throughout the rules by a d number now
there's gonna be two numbers
you'll have the number of dice that
you're rolling
a d and then a number denoting the
number of sides on the dice
so your standard dice is a one d6 a six
sided dice
you'd roll one of them if it was two
standard dice you're rolling what would
a bjt
two d six hey pop is passed
oh my god i had to write that down
so yeah the most common would be one d20
you'll be rolling them
all the time anyway that is honestly the
very basics that you need
that and a pen and paper going on to
the pens sheets character sheets now you
may have seen some of these
they have a load of text a load of
numbers over on them
and we are going to go through all of
them eventually
but right now we're just giving a quick
overview of what what do you what's the
biggest thing that jumps out to you on a
dnd sheet
well when i first saw a d d shape that
was on um joss's campaign
and i remember she had to hold our hands
through it because when i first saw it
it was just
a lot of information
and a lot of blank spaces and that was
really kind of intimidating
yeah um i think when we filled it out we
went from left to right
which was kind of nice yeah on the left
hand side you'll see the
main skills which are strength dexterity
constitution
intelligence wisdom and charisma we'll
come back to those
you'll also see some of the minor skills
around as well as the saving throws
these are really the meat and potatoes
of dnd that and the top boxes
the rest of it is more kind of character
building and reminders
for rules specific to your characters so
i feel the real
core of like the gameplay of d and d is
really on the left-hand side so it's a
good place to fill out first
yeah the left hand has like the numbers
and stats
more and then the right hand has more
kind of like
attributes and text and stuff like that
yeah over on the right hand side you'll
find things like your ideals
your bonds and your flaws which uh
i've played in campaigns where in fact
the one we do now we don't fill them out
at all
we kind of just play through them and
develop them like as we go
really yeah actually the first campaign
that i played i
filled out every single box very
detailed
and i was very disappointed actually
when
it didn't turn out to be very relevant i
i also
it was like in part because it's not
relevant to
the campaign that i was playing but it
was also because it wasn't relevant to
me as i started like yeah playing my
character
it was just different so i find that um
it really does kind of fall into one of
two categories either you're paying
a lot of attention to them or eventually
they kind of fall by the wayside as you
create more
flaws and develop your character more in
a game i've played in some games where
you're creating a character that you are
playing that isn't you
you need to develop every aspect of this
character before you come in
and people do this to varying degrees so
i've played in some games that use the
ideals bonds and flaws as
key parts of the whole campaign so
you design them all before you get into
the campaign and you really stick with
them and they can change
as you go but you really have to adhere
to these as you role play
and you'll get bonuses from the dm
sometimes for doing so
is that something that you establish
with your dm like early on
yeah that is definitely something that
should come up in session zero which
we'll have an episode on
later um episode zero episode i should
have mentioned
but yeah i mean that's really uh the
character sheet
in all we're gonna go through each part
of it individually
um when we get to it we'll have episodes
on everything but
right now that's our overview i know
jt you like having digital sheets
yes i do see i'm a paper guy this is
this is
right we're getting into the gloves are
off
we're going straight into it so i i'm a
dm i currently dm jt
in our normal game and i
hate digital sheets i i don't like
people having their
noses in their phones i like everything
on pen and paper i like being able to
scribble everything out i personally
like the kind of when i'm playing
as a character as a pc um i like the
visceral feel of it having a sheet and
just
being out of the kind of digital world
um so how does it affect you as a dm
when
other people are using electronic sheets
versus
pen and paper so what i see a lot of
and it's not everyone by all means but a
lot of people
will and this is this is like i
i understand it makes me sound like a
bit of an [ __ ] as well
but like you can see they're on their
phones or their laptops and they're
looking at something else
like they're not quite paying attention
and they'll come back and you've got to
kind of rope them in
which can sometimes just be um not much
at all most of the time it's nothing
normally they just come back in they
haven't missed anything but sometimes
they'll miss something key
and you've got to repay the play the
last like 10 minutes
so it's like the distracting element
yeah there is a distraction to it
also um i think people the way people
use them almost as a barrier to other
people
they'll have their laptop up in front of
you create a physical barrier
and i can get it sounds a bit like
wishy-washy or whatever
or having their phone up when you have a
piece of paper that you can pass around
easily if people need to look at your
stats or whatever
or you can just spin around there it is
instead of shuffling around a laptop or
handing over a phone
i think i think it's a more everyone's
on the same playing ground
no one's on different devices everyone
has the same type of paper
everyone has the same pencils it's it's
a small difference but i think it has
kind of big ramifications to the flow of
the game um
so then what does that mean for things
like because i don't just use an
electronic
character sheet oh no i use an
electronic treasury
an electronic inventory electronic spell
list
like all that stuff is digital baby like
so what is the what is the advantage
then of having all this on
pen and paper uh without having the
convenience of this all existing on your
phone
i'll concede that a lot of it is
kind of unfeasible for the most part and
like when you have the other options
available
when you get we're currently 14th level
are you guys 14
i should really know that 13 14. yes
now um yeah i mean at that point you
have so many abilities
and spells and things to keep track of
that people do forget them
especially if you have them on multiple
sheets of paper especially when you've
had those pieces of paper for
how long have you had your sheets two
years now yeah cases yeah
yeah we've been playing this campaign
for two years erase marks start to burn
holes yeah exactly so i mean i'm not
denying the
um benefits of a digital sheet that's
why i'm perfectly okay
for you guys to have your treasury on a
digital sheet because the amount of
[ __ ] you guys accumulate goodness yeah
and then they also have vehicles
right yeah and being able to have like a
vehicle sheet with the cart that they
guys have and they have a portable hole
what's in the portable hole
they have two portable holes actually
what's in each one
and also spell books being able to just
click it i mean
flick it up and it'd just be there that
is just a godsend really i remember
playing
long before that when i was like 12 or
whatever you got to fight over the
players handbooks
yeah and it does slow down the game and
once you start having a digital version
of that it's hard to go back
i think a good middle ground that we
have in our
game at least for me personally is that
i
manage all of the like kind of
accounting
all of the numbers stuff that i don't
want to really do like things like
keeping track of the whole lexicon of
spells
and all of the money and transactions
and stuff that happen
those can be electronic because those
can happen in like three seconds
on a phone as opposed to like much
longer on
pen and paper but i do like having
little personal booklet character sheet
oh
so i found on reddit and this kind of
little personal
character sheet it's a booklet it's
eight pages it's basically an a4 that
you fold up to a like those old
microsoft publisher christmas cards yes
yeah
and it just it just has what do you how
do you find that because i've never used
them
i like it a lot it is it is not all of
the information on your character sheet
it kind of is like trying to take uh all
of the information of a character sheet
and then boiling it down to like what
are your like you know top 10
most used things and then focusing on
that
like there's a section on just can trips
right not spells it doesn't have all
your spells it just has cantrips
yeah it's actually gonna be the things
you use the most it tries to predict the
things that you're going to use like
very frequently and then have like that
and i like that um because it's like a
very easy reference point and it keeps
it like a small
phone size thing yeah that you can just
have
um to flip through for all of your main
like
your main things that you do on a
day-to-day basis yeah
i think that's kind of what makes a
happy medium is the the
the character sheets which is by far and
away the thing you're gonna be referring
to the most we use on paper
but you only use the digital spell books
when you're
casting a spell yeah or when you're
bringing things in and out of an
inventory
um so those are much less frequent
there are also alternatives to that
spell cards i've used spell cards in the
past
those are pretty great being able to
just lay out your cards or even have
them like in a binder and just have all
your cards there that you're
ready to use i think they're pretty dope
i don't i don't have a good system for
an inventory though
yeah i think digital is the way to go
for an expanding inventory first few
levels like yeah you can write it all
down but
when you really get deep yeah be digital
personal anecdote i am the only person
who uses the digital
inventory in our group and i'm also the
only person to have ever used a potion
i mean yeah i remember that
potion of haste so the next thing we're
going to touch on
is the flow of the game as you play so
jt as
as a pc what is your experience when you
play d d what actually happens
so um like a typical session do you mean
i mean like the on the micro not the so
much the macro
like what is the flow of gameplay
okay well it seems to kind of break down
into like
um two bits there's like the non-combat
bit and then the combat bit and those
are like distinctly different
yeah definitely um the non-combat bit is
more about kind of like solving problems
having an identity
as a team being able to come up with
like
what it is that we like what are our
goals and objectives
agreeing on stuff it's a lot more like
social
yeah you know than it is like uh
strictly d
as rules and of course there's like
abilities that we can use to like
achieve these goals and non-combat sort
of ways
um and then there's the combat section
which is much more
oriented on like what can i do
personally in this
context or something like yeah like my
then you're going like that's when i use
my character sheet
my all of my other stuff like a lot more
because
it's much more rules yes heavy
at that point because dnd is at its
basis
a combat system i think i think the the
role-playing element
is much less fleshed out in d than the
combat system
um so i it also comes up when we cast
spells in our game
um as long as you can reasonably pitch
it to me
i'll accept any spell effect really
if you can read the description of the
spell and it like works out to what
i i think would happen i think it's
reasonable as a dm
um then i'll accept it like maybe
like hand waving some of the letters of
the law as it were
but in combat i mean when when things
are much more built around stats and hp
and you have numbers that you have to
make
be zero yeah then
then you've got to go to you've got to
make it a bit more uh
mathy i guess would be the word so how
does
again from a play standpoint what is the
like interaction with me
so um that's my job most of the time i
feel like
you phase in and out of existence that
that's interesting yeah that like you
take a presence when you establish
something
right you establish the environment
right like there's usually like a point
in every new place or new whatever
where you kind of lay down the land
of like what we're looking at where we
are and establishing like some basic
things like that so that's when you're
very like present like we're all paying
attention to you
and you usually give us something to
work with
then we receive that like you know ball
of clay and
we try to kind of like work with it um
and create some kind of story or like
idea of what we want to do from there
yeah i think at its heart d and d is a
collaborative storytelling
yeah experience i think beyond anything
that's what it is at its best
definitely played in games that were
just five five five five five five
fights
i move five feet and i invoke this
dungeons and
dragons yeah it is dungeons and there
are dragons
all there will um
but i definitely think dean did it's
best and the most fun i've had and all
the stories that you see online and the
memes it all comes from the role play
aspect
which at its heart it's just skill
checks but we'll come back to that
talking about skill checks
i think it's important to touch on some
of the very basic mechanics of the core
of dnd which is the rolling of dice what
type of
dice rolls there are so there are
skill checks jc what's a skill check a
skill trick is something that your dm
makes you do
so that you fail at something
yeah basically it's you'll see on your
uh character sheet
there'll be all those skills if one of
them is animal handling
for example if you want to ride a horse
i might make you take an animal handling
check
and we'll see if you pass to pass you've
got a roll equal or higher than a dc
which is a difficulty class which is
at its core a kind of arbitrary number
um that you have to roll higher than
using your skills
which add numbers to your given dice rot
and that's your skill checks you have
saving throws what's a saving throw hit
me with it
a saving throw is when dm throws
something
at you that you
get to see whether or not you succeed or
fail
in yeah yeah if
if there is a danger coming towards you
then
how do you deal with that danger and
they relate to the
six basic stats not so much your skills
so i've seen you do a combination of
sometimes you'll have
a saving throw when it's like there's
some event that happens like a dragon
shoots a fireball at you or whatever
and then you'll make us make a kind of
saving throw
but is there ever a situation where like
a player can change
that saving throw depending on what they
want to do to react to these things
yeah definitely i think one of the the
key things
as a dm is to always be open
to something players pitch and that
doesn't mean say yes to everything
because
goodness gracious players pitch some
[ __ ]
but um if they can give me something
that they do like
if you can give me a reason as to why
that should be a constitution check
maybe like you have some curse on you
that makes you
made of stone and this fire breath
wouldn't do much to you
maybe i should just withstand it like
would that apply to something like
getting behind your shield
would that turn into like a constant i
think that i think that falls into the
dexterity how quickly you raise your
shield
okay i think when it comes down to um
when it gives you a check like that
in the rules how you flavor it is kind
of up to you
um but i think there's many ways to cut
that pie
as it were um so yeah that's
that's your saving throws the other one
is attack rolls and damage rolls
um attack rolls we use to hit
to see if you can hit something you're
rolling against someone's ac which is
basically their armor class
those are the things that people will
ask you the most about as to what do you
add
to that model yes people get this mixed
up
all the time throughout dnd you
only add things for the most part
to your attack roles a lot of things
will add things to attack roles
and not so much will add things to
damage robs
unless you're a barbarian exactly
um there's obviously a wealth of
exceptions like special armors
special um weapons and all that but for
the most part that i see
you are more likely to get a plus to
your attack role to hit
than you are to your damage like if you
add your proficiency it'll normally be
to the attack roll into the damage or
whatever
obviously there's a million exceptions
to everything but i think those are all
the
main checks the main dice rolls
have i missed anything right so like
going through the character sheet we've
gotten like the saving throws skill
checks
attack rules there's like the three big
things yeah i think there's the i mean
there's there's a
load of other dicers but those that's
the meat and potatoes of the day
okay what is a proficiency by the way
you mentioned that earlier when you're
talking about skill checks
uh so a proficiency when you create your
character you'll be given
an opportunity to choose proficiencies
through a myriad of means there's three
different ways when building your
character to get proficiencies that
we'll go into but
they basically mean that you add your
proficiency
bonus which is a number that goes up
the more levels you have so for the
first few levels you'll just get a plus
one
then it will go up to a plus two if
you're proficient in that
skill that i'm asking you to roll a
skill check for
then you will add your proficiency bonus
to that role
it maxes out at a plus six
um we play a variant though don't we jt
yes
do you want to talk about the variant
you can you can give us your thoughts on
it
mixed feelings actually um i it is it is
popular with our group though
so the variant that we play is that we
have a dice roll that we make on
proficiency checks instead of what
normally is a static number that you
just add
yeah the dice roll means that
you could potentially get a lot more
than
your like normal proficiency bonus
whenever you do something like attack
or make a skill check but it could also
be lower
so it adds kind of a degree of
randomness to the successor
which definitely gets wider
the higher up you go when you reach the
upper echelons of your levels
um you're rolling a d12 which gives you
a huge degree of success or failure
whereas at your low levels when it's a
d4 i mean
it's you're not like changing it by too
much
yeah which can be weird as an experience
as a player
in the sense that sometimes like when
you're doing the same thing
in different circumstances it could be
so much more successful in one
circumstance than it is another
and it can get kind of weird to like
envision that as your character
you know being so different yes
one of the ways i think that i could
remedy it i'm definitely about it is
a lot of people play d and d with a 20s
an
automatic success no matter what you're
doing that's how you seduce the dragon
and one is an automatic failure no
matter what
um i think one of the that's probably
the biggest i'd call it a mistake
as a dm to allow that if you are
rolling a 20 if you want to play with
critical successes
uh you can but that's not in the rules
to play in them with skill checks if you
roll a 20 it's just a 20 in a skill
check
the crit success and the crypt fails are
only for attack rolls
so um we play a kind of crits because i
mean let's face it they're fun
yeah fun as balls but um
it's really up to you how to play it i i
would definitely
play with crits but temper them like if
someone wants to seduce the dragon
no they can't even a 20 is not going to
make the impossible possible
even if you're rolling a 37 with all
your
um like amazingness that
succeeds just as much as a 25 if it's a
dc 15 or something they've got to roll
at 15 or higher
i think there definitely should be a
limit the problem with
that comes with that is temporary player
expectations
yeah i feel like that would only really
um
be a problem though if you either have
precedence on that always succeeding
which we do
yeah or if uh players have played in
other games
where dm's have had different yeah
second-hand presence then
yeah yeah i mean again it's really
something that
can be solved just by having good and
open communication
with your party zero yeah session zero
but
not ending it at session zero you should
if ever there's a problem with your dm
you should just be able to talk to them
in like a grown-up manner
should be like hey i think this is a
problem and it works both ways
the dm should be able to talk to players
which statistically speaking the
majority of
listeners to this will be and um
yeah you just got to accept that the
dm's rule is final at the end
and sometimes that can suck especially
if you have a kind of power hungry dm
which i have been under the thumb of
uh which is never fun but when you have
that kind of open dialogue it just makes
everything much better
so how would you recommend a player be
able to approach
communicating with their dm on something
that they either are confused about or
that they disagree with
i think that that is going to be a
fantastic topic for a future episode
but we've touched on everything that we
needed to touch on on this uh
first episode we'll see you guys in the
next one
which will be skill checks looking
forward to it
catch you then pew pew see ya
you
