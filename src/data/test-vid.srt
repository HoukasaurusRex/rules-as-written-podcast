00:19
academy of dreams [ __ ]
00:31
hey everyone welcome to rules as written
00:34
the new podcast from two handsome devils
00:37
i'm toby
00:37
i'm the handsome devil hey
00:39
[Music]
00:41
and we are gonna be looking in this
00:43
podcast
00:44
and the rules of d and how you can apply
00:46
them and also the kind of social aspect
00:49
so
00:49
jt what do you like about d d
00:53
all right it's all right i guess
00:58
so this this first episode we're going
01:01
to try and do a kind of
01:01
introduction to d the whole the whole
01:04
shebang if you've only got 15 minutes to
01:06
tell someone what d d is how to play it
01:10
send them this this episode and
01:11
hopefully we'll do a good job so the
01:13
first thing we should go over is the
01:15
basics
01:16
i think dice is a good place to start
01:18
what do you think
01:19
sure yeah i mean every every game's got
01:23
some physical thing that's the
01:26
so yeah d uses seven dice
01:30
that are in a wonderful myriad of shapes
01:33
and sizes
01:34
yeah especially the one that you lost
01:38
so dice um is the basis of any dnd game
01:41
really
01:41
you have your seven dice and each of
01:45
them are denoted
01:46
throughout the rules by a d number now
01:48
there's gonna be two numbers
01:50
you'll have the number of dice that
01:52
you're rolling
01:53
a d and then a number denoting the
01:56
number of sides on the dice
01:57
so your standard dice is a one d6 a six
02:01
sided dice
02:01
you'd roll one of them if it was two
02:04
standard dice you're rolling what would
02:05
a bjt
02:07
two d six hey pop is passed
02:10
oh my god i had to write that down
02:14
so yeah the most common would be one d20
02:16
you'll be rolling them
02:17
all the time anyway that is honestly the
02:20
very basics that you need
02:22
that and a pen and paper going on to
02:25
the pens sheets character sheets now you
02:28
may have seen some of these
02:30
they have a load of text a load of
02:31
numbers over on them
02:33
and we are going to go through all of
02:34
them eventually
02:36
but right now we're just giving a quick
02:37
overview of what what do you what's the
02:39
biggest thing that jumps out to you on a
02:40
dnd sheet
02:41
well when i first saw a d d shape that
02:44
was on um joss's campaign
02:45
and i remember she had to hold our hands
02:47
through it because when i first saw it
02:49
it was just
02:50
a lot of information
02:53
and a lot of blank spaces and that was
02:55
really kind of intimidating
02:57
yeah um i think when we filled it out we
02:59
went from left to right
03:01
which was kind of nice yeah on the left
03:02
hand side you'll see the
03:04
main skills which are strength dexterity
03:08
constitution
03:09
intelligence wisdom and charisma we'll
03:11
come back to those
03:12
you'll also see some of the minor skills
03:14
around as well as the saving throws
03:16
these are really the meat and potatoes
03:18
of dnd that and the top boxes
03:20
the rest of it is more kind of character
03:22
building and reminders
03:23
for rules specific to your characters so
03:25
i feel the real
03:26
core of like the gameplay of d and d is
03:29
really on the left-hand side so it's a
03:31
good place to fill out first
03:32
yeah the left hand has like the numbers
03:35
and stats
03:36
more and then the right hand has more
03:38
kind of like
03:40
attributes and text and stuff like that
03:43
yeah over on the right hand side you'll
03:45
find things like your ideals
03:47
your bonds and your flaws which uh
03:50
i've played in campaigns where in fact
03:52
the one we do now we don't fill them out
03:54
at all
03:54
we kind of just play through them and
03:56
develop them like as we go
03:58
really yeah actually the first campaign
04:00
that i played i
04:01
filled out every single box very
04:04
detailed
04:05
and i was very disappointed actually
04:08
when
04:09
it didn't turn out to be very relevant i
04:11
i also
04:12
it was like in part because it's not
04:14
relevant to
04:16
the campaign that i was playing but it
04:18
was also because it wasn't relevant to
04:20
me as i started like yeah playing my
04:23
character
04:24
it was just different so i find that um
04:27
it really does kind of fall into one of
04:29
two categories either you're paying
04:31
a lot of attention to them or eventually
04:34
they kind of fall by the wayside as you
04:36
create more
04:36
flaws and develop your character more in
04:38
a game i've played in some games where
04:41
you're creating a character that you are
04:44
playing that isn't you
04:45
you need to develop every aspect of this
04:47
character before you come in
04:49
and people do this to varying degrees so
04:51
i've played in some games that use the
04:53
ideals bonds and flaws as
04:56
key parts of the whole campaign so
05:00
you design them all before you get into
05:02
the campaign and you really stick with
05:04
them and they can change
05:06
as you go but you really have to adhere
05:09
to these as you role play
05:10
and you'll get bonuses from the dm
05:12
sometimes for doing so
05:13
is that something that you establish
05:15
with your dm like early on
05:17
yeah that is definitely something that
05:18
should come up in session zero which
05:20
we'll have an episode on
05:21
later um episode zero episode i should
05:25
have mentioned
05:28
but yeah i mean that's really uh the
05:30
character sheet
05:31
in all we're gonna go through each part
05:33
of it individually
05:35
um when we get to it we'll have episodes
05:38
on everything but
05:39
right now that's our overview i know
05:43
jt you like having digital sheets
05:46
yes i do see i'm a paper guy this is
05:48
this is
05:49
right we're getting into the gloves are
05:51
off
05:53
we're going straight into it so i i'm a
05:56
dm i currently dm jt
05:58
in our normal game and i
06:01
hate digital sheets i i don't like
06:04
people having their
06:05
noses in their phones i like everything
06:07
on pen and paper i like being able to
06:09
scribble everything out i personally
06:11
like the kind of when i'm playing
06:13
as a character as a pc um i like the
06:16
visceral feel of it having a sheet and
06:19
just
06:20
being out of the kind of digital world
06:23
um so how does it affect you as a dm
06:26
when
06:26
other people are using electronic sheets
06:28
versus
06:29
pen and paper so what i see a lot of
06:32
and it's not everyone by all means but a
06:34
lot of people
06:35
will and this is this is like i
06:38
i understand it makes me sound like a
06:40
bit of an [ __ ] as well
06:42
but like you can see they're on their
06:43
phones or their laptops and they're
06:45
looking at something else
06:46
like they're not quite paying attention
06:47
and they'll come back and you've got to
06:48
kind of rope them in
06:50
which can sometimes just be um not much
06:52
at all most of the time it's nothing
06:54
normally they just come back in they
06:55
haven't missed anything but sometimes
06:56
they'll miss something key
06:57
and you've got to repay the play the
06:59
last like 10 minutes
07:00
so it's like the distracting element
07:02
yeah there is a distraction to it
07:04
also um i think people the way people
07:08
use them almost as a barrier to other
07:10
people
07:11
they'll have their laptop up in front of
07:13
you create a physical barrier
07:14
and i can get it sounds a bit like
07:16
wishy-washy or whatever
07:18
or having their phone up when you have a
07:20
piece of paper that you can pass around
07:22
easily if people need to look at your
07:24
stats or whatever
07:25
or you can just spin around there it is
07:27
instead of shuffling around a laptop or
07:29
handing over a phone
07:31
i think i think it's a more everyone's
07:32
on the same playing ground
07:34
no one's on different devices everyone
07:36
has the same type of paper
07:38
everyone has the same pencils it's it's
07:40
a small difference but i think it has
07:42
kind of big ramifications to the flow of
07:44
the game um
07:45
so then what does that mean for things
07:48
like because i don't just use an
07:49
electronic
07:50
character sheet oh no i use an
07:52
electronic treasury
07:54
an electronic inventory electronic spell
07:57
list
07:58
like all that stuff is digital baby like
08:01
so what is the what is the advantage
08:04
then of having all this on
08:05
pen and paper uh without having the
08:09
convenience of this all existing on your
08:11
phone
08:11
i'll concede that a lot of it is
08:14
kind of unfeasible for the most part and
08:17
like when you have the other options
08:18
available
08:19
when you get we're currently 14th level
08:21
are you guys 14
08:22
i should really know that 13 14. yes
08:26
now um yeah i mean at that point you
08:30
have so many abilities
08:32
and spells and things to keep track of
08:34
that people do forget them
08:35
especially if you have them on multiple
08:37
sheets of paper especially when you've
08:38
had those pieces of paper for
08:40
how long have you had your sheets two
08:42
years now yeah cases yeah
08:44
yeah we've been playing this campaign
08:45
for two years erase marks start to burn
08:47
holes yeah exactly so i mean i'm not
08:50
denying the
08:51
um benefits of a digital sheet that's
08:53
why i'm perfectly okay
08:55
for you guys to have your treasury on a
08:56
digital sheet because the amount of
08:59
[ __ ] you guys accumulate goodness yeah
09:01
and then they also have vehicles
09:03
right yeah and being able to have like a
09:05
vehicle sheet with the cart that they
09:07
guys have and they have a portable hole
09:08
what's in the portable hole
09:10
they have two portable holes actually
09:12
what's in each one
09:14
and also spell books being able to just
09:16
click it i mean
09:17
flick it up and it'd just be there that
09:19
is just a godsend really i remember
09:21
playing
09:22
long before that when i was like 12 or
09:23
whatever you got to fight over the
09:25
players handbooks
09:26
yeah and it does slow down the game and
09:28
once you start having a digital version
09:30
of that it's hard to go back
09:31
i think a good middle ground that we
09:34
have in our
09:34
game at least for me personally is that
09:37
i
09:38
manage all of the like kind of
09:40
accounting
09:41
all of the numbers stuff that i don't
09:42
want to really do like things like
09:44
keeping track of the whole lexicon of
09:46
spells
09:46
and all of the money and transactions
09:49
and stuff that happen
09:50
those can be electronic because those
09:52
can happen in like three seconds
09:54
on a phone as opposed to like much
09:56
longer on
09:57
pen and paper but i do like having
10:01
little personal booklet character sheet
10:04
oh
10:04
so i found on reddit and this kind of
10:07
little personal
10:08
character sheet it's a booklet it's
10:09
eight pages it's basically an a4 that
10:11
you fold up to a like those old
10:13
microsoft publisher christmas cards yes
10:16
yeah
10:17
and it just it just has what do you how
10:18
do you find that because i've never used
10:20
them
10:20
i like it a lot it is it is not all of
10:22
the information on your character sheet
10:24
it kind of is like trying to take uh all
10:27
of the information of a character sheet
10:28
and then boiling it down to like what
10:30
are your like you know top 10
10:32
most used things and then focusing on
10:34
that
10:35
like there's a section on just can trips
10:37
right not spells it doesn't have all
10:39
your spells it just has cantrips
10:40
yeah it's actually gonna be the things
10:42
you use the most it tries to predict the
10:43
things that you're going to use like
10:45
very frequently and then have like that
10:47
and i like that um because it's like a
10:51
very easy reference point and it keeps
10:53
it like a small
10:55
phone size thing yeah that you can just
10:58
have
10:59
um to flip through for all of your main
11:01
like
11:02
your main things that you do on a
11:04
day-to-day basis yeah
11:05
i think that's kind of what makes a
11:07
happy medium is the the
11:08
the character sheets which is by far and
11:10
away the thing you're gonna be referring
11:11
to the most we use on paper
11:13
but you only use the digital spell books
11:15
when you're
11:17
casting a spell yeah or when you're
11:19
bringing things in and out of an
11:20
inventory
11:21
um so those are much less frequent
11:25
there are also alternatives to that
11:26
spell cards i've used spell cards in the
11:28
past
11:29
those are pretty great being able to
11:31
just lay out your cards or even have
11:33
them like in a binder and just have all
11:34
your cards there that you're
11:36
ready to use i think they're pretty dope
11:39
i don't i don't have a good system for
11:41
an inventory though
11:43
yeah i think digital is the way to go
11:44
for an expanding inventory first few
11:46
levels like yeah you can write it all
11:48
down but
11:49
when you really get deep yeah be digital
11:51
personal anecdote i am the only person
11:53
who uses the digital
11:54
inventory in our group and i'm also the
11:57
only person to have ever used a potion
12:03
i mean yeah i remember that
12:06
potion of haste so the next thing we're
12:09
going to touch on
12:10
is the flow of the game as you play so
12:12
jt as
12:13
as a pc what is your experience when you
12:16
play d d what actually happens
12:18
so um like a typical session do you mean
12:22
i mean like the on the micro not the so
12:24
much the macro
12:25
like what is the flow of gameplay
12:28
okay well it seems to kind of break down
12:31
into like
12:32
um two bits there's like the non-combat
12:36
bit and then the combat bit and those
12:37
are like distinctly different
12:39
yeah definitely um the non-combat bit is
12:42
more about kind of like solving problems
12:44
having an identity
12:46
as a team being able to come up with
12:48
like
12:49
what it is that we like what are our
12:51
goals and objectives
12:52
agreeing on stuff it's a lot more like
12:55
social
12:56
yeah you know than it is like uh
12:58
strictly d
12:59
as rules and of course there's like
13:02
abilities that we can use to like
13:04
achieve these goals and non-combat sort
13:06
of ways
13:07
um and then there's the combat section
13:09
which is much more
13:10
oriented on like what can i do
13:13
personally in this
13:15
context or something like yeah like my
13:17
then you're going like that's when i use
13:18
my character sheet
13:20
my all of my other stuff like a lot more
13:23
because
13:23
it's much more rules yes heavy
13:26
at that point because dnd is at its
13:29
basis
13:30
a combat system i think i think the the
13:33
role-playing element
13:34
is much less fleshed out in d than the
13:37
combat system
13:39
um so i it also comes up when we cast
13:42
spells in our game
13:44
um as long as you can reasonably pitch
13:47
it to me
13:48
i'll accept any spell effect really
13:51
if you can read the description of the
13:53
spell and it like works out to what
13:56
i i think would happen i think it's
13:57
reasonable as a dm
13:59
um then i'll accept it like maybe
14:03
like hand waving some of the letters of
14:05
the law as it were
14:06
but in combat i mean when when things
14:09
are much more built around stats and hp
14:11
and you have numbers that you have to
14:13
make
14:14
be zero yeah then
14:17
then you've got to go to you've got to
14:19
make it a bit more uh
14:20
mathy i guess would be the word so how
14:23
does
14:24
again from a play standpoint what is the
14:26
like interaction with me
14:28
so um that's my job most of the time i
14:32
feel like
14:32
you phase in and out of existence that
14:36
that's interesting yeah that like you
14:38
take a presence when you establish
14:40
something
14:41
right you establish the environment
14:43
right like there's usually like a point
14:45
in every new place or new whatever
14:48
where you kind of lay down the land
14:52
of like what we're looking at where we
14:53
are and establishing like some basic
14:56
things like that so that's when you're
14:58
very like present like we're all paying
15:00
attention to you
15:01
and you usually give us something to
15:04
work with
15:05
then we receive that like you know ball
15:07
of clay and
15:08
we try to kind of like work with it um
15:12
and create some kind of story or like
15:14
idea of what we want to do from there
15:16
yeah i think at its heart d and d is a
15:18
collaborative storytelling
15:20
yeah experience i think beyond anything
15:22
that's what it is at its best
15:25
definitely played in games that were
15:27
just five five five five five five
15:29
fights
15:30
i move five feet and i invoke this
15:32
dungeons and
15:33
dragons yeah it is dungeons and there
15:35
are dragons
15:37
all there will um
15:40
but i definitely think dean did it's
15:41
best and the most fun i've had and all
15:43
the stories that you see online and the
15:44
memes it all comes from the role play
15:46
aspect
15:47
which at its heart it's just skill
15:49
checks but we'll come back to that
15:50
talking about skill checks
15:52
i think it's important to touch on some
15:54
of the very basic mechanics of the core
15:56
of dnd which is the rolling of dice what
15:58
type of
15:59
dice rolls there are so there are
16:03
skill checks jc what's a skill check a
16:05
skill trick is something that your dm
16:07
makes you do
16:08
so that you fail at something
16:12
yeah basically it's you'll see on your
16:14
uh character sheet
16:15
there'll be all those skills if one of
16:18
them is animal handling
16:19
for example if you want to ride a horse
16:21
i might make you take an animal handling
16:23
check
16:23
and we'll see if you pass to pass you've
16:26
got a roll equal or higher than a dc
16:29
which is a difficulty class which is
16:33
at its core a kind of arbitrary number
16:35
um that you have to roll higher than
16:37
using your skills
16:38
which add numbers to your given dice rot
16:41
and that's your skill checks you have
16:43
saving throws what's a saving throw hit
16:46
me with it
16:47
a saving throw is when dm throws
16:50
something
16:50
at you that you
16:53
get to see whether or not you succeed or
16:56
fail
16:56
in yeah yeah if
16:59
if there is a danger coming towards you
17:02
then
17:03
how do you deal with that danger and
17:06
they relate to the
17:07
six basic stats not so much your skills
17:11
so i've seen you do a combination of
17:14
sometimes you'll have
17:15
a saving throw when it's like there's
17:18
some event that happens like a dragon
17:20
shoots a fireball at you or whatever
17:22
and then you'll make us make a kind of
17:25
saving throw
17:26
but is there ever a situation where like
17:28
a player can change
17:29
that saving throw depending on what they
17:31
want to do to react to these things
17:33
yeah definitely i think one of the the
17:36
key things
17:37
as a dm is to always be open
17:40
to something players pitch and that
17:43
doesn't mean say yes to everything
17:44
because
17:44
goodness gracious players pitch some
17:47
[ __ ]
17:48
but um if they can give me something
17:50
that they do like
17:52
if you can give me a reason as to why
17:53
that should be a constitution check
17:56
maybe like you have some curse on you
17:59
that makes you
18:00
made of stone and this fire breath
18:02
wouldn't do much to you
18:03
maybe i should just withstand it like
18:05
would that apply to something like
18:07
getting behind your shield
18:08
would that turn into like a constant i
18:09
think that i think that falls into the
18:11
dexterity how quickly you raise your
18:13
shield
18:14
okay i think when it comes down to um
18:16
when it gives you a check like that
18:18
in the rules how you flavor it is kind
18:21
of up to you
18:22
um but i think there's many ways to cut
18:25
that pie
18:26
as it were um so yeah that's
18:30
that's your saving throws the other one
18:32
is attack rolls and damage rolls
18:34
um attack rolls we use to hit
18:38
to see if you can hit something you're
18:40
rolling against someone's ac which is
18:42
basically their armor class
18:43
those are the things that people will
18:44
ask you the most about as to what do you
18:46
add
18:47
to that model yes people get this mixed
18:51
up
18:51
all the time throughout dnd you
18:54
only add things for the most part
18:58
to your attack roles a lot of things
19:00
will add things to attack roles
19:01
and not so much will add things to
19:03
damage robs
19:05
unless you're a barbarian exactly
19:08
um there's obviously a wealth of
19:10
exceptions like special armors
19:12
special um weapons and all that but for
19:15
the most part that i see
19:16
you are more likely to get a plus to
19:18
your attack role to hit
19:20
than you are to your damage like if you
19:22
add your proficiency it'll normally be
19:24
to the attack roll into the damage or
19:25
whatever
19:26
obviously there's a million exceptions
19:28
to everything but i think those are all
19:30
the
19:30
main checks the main dice rolls
19:34
have i missed anything right so like
19:36
going through the character sheet we've
19:37
gotten like the saving throws skill
19:39
checks
19:40
attack rules there's like the three big
19:42
things yeah i think there's the i mean
19:43
there's there's a
19:44
load of other dicers but those that's
19:46
the meat and potatoes of the day
19:48
okay what is a proficiency by the way
19:50
you mentioned that earlier when you're
19:52
talking about skill checks
19:53
uh so a proficiency when you create your
19:55
character you'll be given
19:56
an opportunity to choose proficiencies
19:59
through a myriad of means there's three
20:02
different ways when building your
20:03
character to get proficiencies that
20:04
we'll go into but
20:06
they basically mean that you add your
20:08
proficiency
20:09
bonus which is a number that goes up
20:13
the more levels you have so for the
20:15
first few levels you'll just get a plus
20:16
one
20:17
then it will go up to a plus two if
20:19
you're proficient in that
20:21
skill that i'm asking you to roll a
20:22
skill check for
20:24
then you will add your proficiency bonus
20:27
to that role
20:28
it maxes out at a plus six
20:32
um we play a variant though don't we jt
20:35
yes
20:35
do you want to talk about the variant
20:37
you can you can give us your thoughts on
20:39
it
20:40
mixed feelings actually um i it is it is
20:43
popular with our group though
20:44
so the variant that we play is that we
20:48
have a dice roll that we make on
20:50
proficiency checks instead of what
20:52
normally is a static number that you
20:54
just add
20:55
yeah the dice roll means that
20:59
you could potentially get a lot more
21:01
than
21:02
your like normal proficiency bonus
21:04
whenever you do something like attack
21:06
or make a skill check but it could also
21:09
be lower
21:10
so it adds kind of a degree of
21:11
randomness to the successor
21:13
which definitely gets wider
21:16
the higher up you go when you reach the
21:19
upper echelons of your levels
21:21
um you're rolling a d12 which gives you
21:25
a huge degree of success or failure
21:28
whereas at your low levels when it's a
21:29
d4 i mean
21:31
it's you're not like changing it by too
21:34
much
21:35
yeah which can be weird as an experience
21:37
as a player
21:38
in the sense that sometimes like when
21:40
you're doing the same thing
21:42
in different circumstances it could be
21:45
so much more successful in one
21:47
circumstance than it is another
21:49
and it can get kind of weird to like
21:52
envision that as your character
21:54
you know being so different yes
21:57
one of the ways i think that i could
22:00
remedy it i'm definitely about it is
22:02
a lot of people play d and d with a 20s
22:05
an
22:05
automatic success no matter what you're
22:07
doing that's how you seduce the dragon
22:09
and one is an automatic failure no
22:13
matter what
22:14
um i think one of the that's probably
22:16
the biggest i'd call it a mistake
22:18
as a dm to allow that if you are
22:21
rolling a 20 if you want to play with
22:24
critical successes
22:26
uh you can but that's not in the rules
22:28
to play in them with skill checks if you
22:30
roll a 20 it's just a 20 in a skill
22:31
check
22:32
the crit success and the crypt fails are
22:34
only for attack rolls
22:36
so um we play a kind of crits because i
22:39
mean let's face it they're fun
22:41
yeah fun as balls but um
22:44
it's really up to you how to play it i i
22:47
would definitely
22:48
play with crits but temper them like if
22:51
someone wants to seduce the dragon
22:52
no they can't even a 20 is not going to
22:55
make the impossible possible
22:57
even if you're rolling a 37 with all
23:00
your
23:01
um like amazingness that
23:04
succeeds just as much as a 25 if it's a
23:08
dc 15 or something they've got to roll
23:10
at 15 or higher
23:11
i think there definitely should be a
23:13
limit the problem with
23:15
that comes with that is temporary player
23:16
expectations
23:18
yeah i feel like that would only really
23:20
um
23:21
be a problem though if you either have
23:23
precedence on that always succeeding
23:25
which we do
23:26
yeah or if uh players have played in
23:29
other games
23:30
where dm's have had different yeah
23:32
second-hand presence then
23:33
yeah yeah i mean again it's really
23:35
something that
23:36
can be solved just by having good and
23:38
open communication
23:40
with your party zero yeah session zero
23:43
but
23:43
not ending it at session zero you should
23:45
if ever there's a problem with your dm
23:47
you should just be able to talk to them
23:48
in like a grown-up manner
23:50
should be like hey i think this is a
23:52
problem and it works both ways
23:54
the dm should be able to talk to players
23:57
which statistically speaking the
23:59
majority of
24:00
listeners to this will be and um
24:04
yeah you just got to accept that the
24:05
dm's rule is final at the end
24:07
and sometimes that can suck especially
24:10
if you have a kind of power hungry dm
24:12
which i have been under the thumb of
24:15
uh which is never fun but when you have
24:18
that kind of open dialogue it just makes
24:19
everything much better
24:21
so how would you recommend a player be
24:24
able to approach
24:25
communicating with their dm on something
24:27
that they either are confused about or
24:28
that they disagree with
24:30
i think that that is going to be a
24:32
fantastic topic for a future episode
24:35
but we've touched on everything that we
24:37
needed to touch on on this uh
24:39
first episode we'll see you guys in the
24:42
next one
24:43
which will be skill checks looking
24:46
forward to it
24:47
catch you then pew pew see ya
25:10
you
