### The Kingdoms of Old

These three races possibly contribute most to the classic lore and literature of fantasy role playing games than anything, but what does D&D say about them in the context of gameplay? Humans are unsurprisingly the most diverse race, with attributes that can create a decent character from any class. Elves lean towards abilities that benefit magic users, while dwarven sturdiness can give your beefier characters a little more beef.

Learning more about the races, their backgrounds in the game, and the benefits and weaknesses they bring to your gameplay can not only help make characters that lean into these expectations, but also inspire ways to subvert these expectations in your own way.

Personally, we like to try and find unique ways to lean into both the strengths and weaknesses of our races. A mountain dwarf wizard might have a different culture around their magic than a high elf, or a human cleric might view their relationship with the gods differently from a hill dwarf.
