### Halflings (1:10 - 11:45)

These little guys tend to get along with most people being generally kind hearted and likable creatures. In your campaigns, you might encounter them as pragmatic merchants in large cities or otherwise as farmers in small, peaceful communities.

Notable traits:

They are a size class Small, and as such have a slightly slower 25ft walking speed, but this also allows them to move through spaces other creatures occupy with their halfling nimbleness trait.

They are brave (advantage on saving throws against being frightened) and lucky (can reroll a 1 on an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll any time)

They get +2 to DEX

They 
do not
 have darkvision

Halfling is a relatively secret language as it's rarely if ever shared, so it can be a good way to avoid prying eyes.

Lightfoot Subrace:

+1 CHA

Naturally Stealthy - can attempt to hide behind any creature at least 1 size class larger

Stout Subrace:

+1 CON

Stout resilience - advantage on poison saving throws and resistance to poison damage

Suggestions:

Consider modifying the Lucky trait to reroll on 2 instead of 1. This is because a 2 is likely a failing roll under most circumstances anyway, and preserving the "critical fail" homerule is something we think really benefits most playstyles.

Because of their high dex and unique traits, they tend to make terrific bards and cunning rogues.

### Gnomes (11:45 - 20:35)

These guys are a little more mischievous than halflings, but generally come from a good place and seldom wish ill on others. Gnomes seem to be almost uncannily happy and love building/tinkering/engineering so in cities they can make excellent artificers of all sorts and in hilly lands often live in cleverly constructed burrows. While almost a footnote in the RaW, their absolute fixation on gems is so weird to us that we can't help but love the idea of working that into any gnome character we make using any wacky logic we can.

Notable traits:

They get +2 INT

Unlike halflings, they do have darkvision

They are a size class Small and with Gnome Cunning they have advantage on all INT, WIS, and CHA saving throws

Gnomish uses Dwarvish script (the runes being similar to how English and Spanish both use the Latin alphabet) and usually possesses more language describing technical properties and scientific knowledge of the natural world.

Forest Gnome Subrace:

+1 DEX

Gain Minor Illusion spell (casting with INT)

Can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts

Rock Gnome Subrace:

+1 CON

Double proficiency on History checks related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices

Tinker - spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth o f materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp) that lasts 24 hours unless 1 hour is spent repairing it, or deconstruct it to regain materials spent. You can have up to 3 at a time. These include Clockwork Toy (animal, monster, or person with 5ft walking speed in a random direction and makes noise), Fire Starter (a lighter), and Music Box (a music box).

Suggestions:

Gnomes can offer a lot of benefits and flexibility to anyone playing as a Wizard.

### Half-Elves (20:35 - 26:25)

Being wanderers and not entirely accepted into either Human or Elf communities, Half-Elves tend to be a bit more self sufficient as well as useful diplomatic envoys between kingdoms. They're uncommon enough that one might go years without encountering another Half-Elf, but might be more commonplace in large cities if they're want to settle down.

Notable traits:

+2 CHA, +1 to any two other ability scores

Unlike humans, they do have darkvision

They have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic canâ€™t put them to sleep

Proficiencies in any 2 skills

Suggestions:

Just like with Humans, Half-Elves have so much versatility that they would match well with any class, but if you want to make extra use of your bonus to CHA, you could choose a class like Bards, Warlocks, or Sorcerers to make the most of it.
