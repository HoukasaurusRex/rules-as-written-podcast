### Master of None

Our key takeaways from multiclassing for beginners are to consider gradually taking levels from another class as you progress instead of creating your "stormblade, rider of wind" idea all at once, make sure to read up on the proficiencies and feats gained from that class, and that cantrips level with your 
character
, not your 
class
 level.

While the difference between character level and class level might take some getting used to, as we say in greater detail in the show it's not so much if you take it in level by level.

For additional reference on multiclassing, check out the Player's Handbook: Chapter 6 pg. 163-165.
